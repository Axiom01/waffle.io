_We're hiring a **Developer Advocate**. Apply [below](#developer-advocate)!_

## Who Are We?

At Waffle.io, we're reinventing the way engineering teams track work. We believe developers shouldn't have to do extra work to update others on their status, so Waffle does it for them.

Waffle.io is an Enterprise Lean Startup, running inside one of the largest independent software corporations in the world, CA Technologies. We believe in rapidly iterating on solutions with our customers, to find problems that are worth solving.

Are you passionate about improving the lives of developers like yourself? Do you thrive in a startup environment, where it’s up to you to solve a wide range of technical problems and work across the stack? If so, we’d love to meet you!

## Who Are You?

We’re looking for **craftswomen and craftsmen** who are **curious**, **creative**, **humble**, and are **empathetic**.

### Craftsmanship

We take pride in what we do. We focus on delivering the right thing to our customers and follow lean startup principles to create minimum lovable products. We strive to make everything we touch just a little bit better when we leave it.

### Curiosity and Creativity

We are disciplined explorers, learning from our customers and trying new things to discover the future of the way engineering teams track work. We believe in the art of the possible. You’ll be a good fit on our team if you like saying [“yes, and”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Yes,_And%22_rule) to new ideas, but can also focus on what needs to get done.

### Humility

We value having a shared vision and coming together as a team to pursue it together. We each bring unique ideas to the table, and we’re excited when we’re able to work together to turn our ideas into something that’s better. You’ll fit in well if you can put aside your own awesomeness to make the team you work with stronger than any one individual.

### Empathy

We’re building a product that we ourselves use every day, and we know we need help from our customers to build the right thing. We value working with and understanding our customers. You’ll be a good fit on our team if you’re excited to meet Waffle’s customers and you’ll go above and beyond to make their day better.

## What’s It Like Working on Waffle.io?

### The Team

We’re a distributed team, with teammates in Boulder, CO and Raleigh, NC.

We run as a startup inside a big company. That means we do our own sales, marketing, devops, and of course product development, and support. Each of us wears many hats.

### The Tech

Waffle.io runs on a Node.js, Angular, CoffeeScript, MongoDB, and Docker stack. We’re hosted using cloud services, but also ship behind the firewall. We have a microservice architecture that’s continuously deployed.

### The Process

We use our own product to manage our work. Anyone in the world can see what we’re up to here: https://waffle.io/waffleio/waffle.io.

### Open Positions

#### Developer Advocate

Do you thrive talking to customers every day and helping them solve problems?

At Waffle.io, we’re looking for someone to engage with engineers who would love to adopt Waffle, and also work with our new customers to help them be more awesome. You’ll wear a couple of different hats:

* Be our brand ambassador. Travel to a couple events a month, including speaking at coding schools (they love Waffle!), meetups, and conferences. Sometimes we’ll be a sponsor, and sometimes you’ll just have swag in a backpack and be part of a community.
* Help new customers be successful in the product. We have hundreds of new users sign up every week, and we want you to help them discover how Waffle makes their team ship better software faster.
* Nurture relationships with our existing customers. Thousands of teams use Waffle every day to get work done, and we want to help them be more successful as their teams grow.

To be great at this role, we think you’ll:
* Have a background coding or working with dev teams. You have to understand the pain that engineering teams experience to be part of the community.
* Have experience in sales or a customer success role for a technical product. We’re not looking for someone with just marketing experience, but someone who has been hands on with customers before.
* Enjoy traveling and engaging with people you don’t know. 
* Be a self starter. You’ll be our first hire of this type, so a lot of the stuff you’re doing will be self initiated.
* Be achievement oriented. We’ll set clear success criteria, and of course iterate as we go. We’ll align the goals we set to our bonus structure so you’ll be rewarded for helping the business grow.

Do you love a startup environment, where you can own responsibility for large parts of a business and be empowered to make real change? Join our team as we change the way software teams track work.
